Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

I create academic programs and courses that monetize academic effort and yield institutional revenue enhancement and stakeholder success.\nI recently was on the faculty at the University of Oklahoma and Estonian Business School, but I spent most of my career on the faculty of Rutgers University. I am an award-winning teacher, researcher, and a leader in online instruction. I also have extensive international academic experiences in Switzerland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Finland, and the UK.\nMy academic research has been published in Journal of Financial Economics, Management Science, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions & Money, European Financial Management, Financial Management, Journal of Financial Services Research, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, European Journal of Operational Research and other journals.

In addition to traditional academic teaching, I have taught various professional review courses since 1999 in Europe, Asia and the U.S. I am a CFA Charterholder, a Certified Financial Risk Manager, and a Professional Risk Manager.

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
